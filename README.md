A fork of mihaip's documentation for the unofficial Google Reader API.
To make sure it won't be lost and to add my notes.

This repository formerly lived at [code.google.com/p/google-reader-api](https://code.google.com/p/google-reader-api/). Between 2010 and 2012 it served as a place for [Mihai Parparita](https://github.com/mihaip) to document and clarify behavior of Google Reader's unofficial API (in combination with the [Friends of the Unofficial Google Reader API](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fougrapi) group). 

Google Reader was [shut down](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/07/a-final-farewell.html) in 2013, this is all purely of historical interest.

The `wiki` directory represents the contents of the original site. GitHub's previewing of the `.wiki` extension doesn't quite line up with the formatting that Google Project Hosting used, so you will need to look at the raw source to fully understand it.
